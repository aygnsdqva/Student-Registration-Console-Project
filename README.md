VI.  Updating Student Information by Index:

First, the index is entered. Then, agreement is requested to update the information of that student. If your response is 'no', the system will return to the main menu. If your response is 'yes', you will be asked which student information (such as first name, last name, age, etc.) you want to change. If you respond with 'yes', you will be prompted to enter a new value. If you respond with 'no', the information will remain unchanged.

As you can see, the student information at index 1 has been updated based on the entered data :

VII. In this program, errors are handled to prevent the system from crashing when letters or large values are entered in numeric inputs, and the program prompt for the value again.
